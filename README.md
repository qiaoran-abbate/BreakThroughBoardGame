## About
This game is played on a checker or chess board, and was originally created by Dan Troyka, who had won the 2001 8 * 8 Game Design Competition, sponsored by “About Board Games, Abstract Games Magazine” and the “Strategy Gaming Society”. The breakthrough game is played on one computer by two players, and moves are made by passing the mouse back and forth between players. The challenges include algorithm design, player’s turn rotation, and exception handling.

It is a simplier version of the chess game. The players strive to to reach the opposite side of the board edge. The first to achieve this wins. The checker pieces can move 1 space to the left, front, and right, and can attack diagnally. Below is a demo of the gameplay, click to view the recording on Youtube.
